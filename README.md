# Ground-Scanner-System
Real‑time 3D scanning and visualization from ESP32 sensor.

📌 Overview

This project is a modular Ground Scanning System designed to capture, process, and visualize subsurface data.
It collects sensor readings in real time, filters the signals, and generates structured output for 2D/3D analysis — useful for research, prototyping, and geophysical experiments.
